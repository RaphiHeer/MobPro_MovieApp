# MovieApp with Ionic

This project was created for education purposes.

I used following tutorial as help for the developement (thx to the writer):
https://ionicacademy.com/ionic-4-app-api-calls/

## How did I set up this app?

Easy peasy lemon squeeze. Create the app with this command:

```
ionic start MovieApp sidemenu
```

The I jumped inside the project and created some pages with following commands:

```
ionic g page search
ionic g page native
ionic g page movieDetails
ionic g page favorites
ionic g service services/movie
```

Create html-pages and page-scripts according to the excercise and this git-repo.

The other functions from the excercise are still pending.
